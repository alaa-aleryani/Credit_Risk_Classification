# Credit Risk Classification

In this Challenge, we used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. We used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

### Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:
* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
